PURPOSE
-------
/*
	Simulates a fight between two heroes, Tortoise and Hare, against a crew of ten pirates. Each scenario gives an advantage to a particular hero by giving them a magic sword.
		Scenario 1: Tortoise gets the magic sword
		Scenario 2: Hare gets the magic sword 
		Scenario 3: No one gets the sword.
	Statistics for each run are accumulated and printed at the end.
	From the statistics we can safely say that the highest chance the heroes have of winning is when Tortoise has the magic sword
